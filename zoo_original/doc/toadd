after Zoo workshop 10/2002
- the semantics of recursive interpreter def. needs to talk about the
  mono-variant nature of the fixpoint algorithm.
- how can we define a must-analysis?
- atomic-function lattice: atomic functions are not closed by meet

after ens01 talk 7/2001
- compare with PAG(program analyzer generator)
- forward/backward fixpoint computation that are interleaved: important for 
  accuracy (also for Woongsik's analysis)
  This is one that is missing in PAG
- ways of composing two program analyses for them to interleave
- find an optimal place for applying the widening operation: non-trivial
- for the query, we can massage the analysis tailored for the query
- model-checking for high-order data?
  objects are functions that return functions
  what would be ctl formula for such data?
- try automating analysis of prolog; they have very good analyzers.

sugar candidates

 setbind ::= setid = setexp <and setbind>
 latbind ::= latid = latexp <and latbind>

--> decision: not allowed, because each set and lattice is translated into
 a single module in nML, which cannot be defined recursively.

 !+ (fn match) e = +{ (fn match) x | x from e }
 !* (fn match) e = *{ (fn match) x | x from e }

--> decision: "map e e'" is supported.
    Hence, above "!+ (fn match) e" is "+(map (fn match) e)"    

 s[(s x)+v/x]
--> decision: not yet

1. extension for solution look-up expression

   <pre|post> varlongid @ e

   not only Eqn names but also cvar

--> decision: yes added

2. syntactic sugar for union in rhsexp

--> decision: yes added

3. signature for nml operations

--> ?
