Files for R mode (adapted from OCaml-2.04/emacs). Kwang, June 2001

How to install:

1. Copy {r.el, r-font.el, r-compat.el}
   to your emacs path directory.

   If you put them in, say, /home/me/emacs,
   then don't forget to add the path to your load-path as follows:

     (setq load-path
             (append load-path
                     (list "/home/me/emacs")))

2. Add the following lines to your .emacs files

    (setq auto-mode-alist
          (append '(("\\.r[i]?" . r-mode))
    		auto-mode-alist))
    (autoload 'r-mode "r" "Major mode for editing R code." t)
    (require 'r-font)

3. Done.
